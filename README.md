## Welcome

The **main.cpp** file in this repository illustrates how to implement the Chain Of Responsibility Design Pattern.

This program was created using **Code::Blocks**, which can be found at **www.codeblocks.org**

To use the program, change the boolean values in the HomeStatus class from true to false, and back again.  A message will be displayed for values of false.
